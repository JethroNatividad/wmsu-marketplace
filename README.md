## Introduction
The digital age has transformed the way we communicate, learn, and conduct business. With the advent of the internet, online platforms have become an integral part of our daily lives, offering convenience and efficiency in various aspects of society. However, the traditional marketplace model, which relies on physical locations and face-to-face interactions, still holds a significant place in our lives. This is particularly true in educational institutions like Western Mindanao State University (WMSU), where students, alumni, and staff often find themselves in need of a platform that facilitates the buying and selling of items within the university community. The lack of such a platform not only hampers the convenience of transactions but also limits the scope of economic exchange within the university

## Project Context
The WMSU Marketplace project aims to address this gap by creating a secure and user-friendly online platform exclusively for the WMSU community. This platform will serve as a digital marketplace where students, alumni, and staff can buy and sell items, fostering a sense of community and economic exchange within the university. The project is rooted in the belief that a local marketplace can enhance campus life by promoting sustainable consumption, encouraging peer-to-peer collaboration, and supporting local entrepreneurship.

## Purpose and Description
The primary purpose of the WMSU Marketplace is to provide a convenient and safe marketplace for WMSU students and staff to buy and sell items, thereby fostering a sense of community and economic exchange within the university. The platform will be designed to be user-friendly, with a responsive and intuitive interface, ensuring that users can easily create, manage, and browse listings. Additionally, the platform will implement secure authentication and authorization using @wmsu.edu.ph email addresses, promoting trust and reliability among users.
